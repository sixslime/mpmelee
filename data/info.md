### Crits
- Reduce Attack Speed by 50% when airborne (not on ground). This makes crits still useful but not just objectively better.
- This may feel cheugy though because the players attack indicator is incosistent when on/off ground.
- perhaps reduce crit damage from 150% -> 140%|130%
    * (detect when player is falling then reduce their attack damage)

### Melee
- Sword : "Area/Crowd Control"
    * the bread and butter basic for most use cases
    * dont change much except reduce attack speed and damage a little
- Axe : "Focused Damage"
    * honestly, the axe as is is pretty balanced, maybe reduce damage just for parity of the rest of the changes.
- Shovel : "Long Range Zone"
    * mid damage
    * low-mid attack speed
    * +10% range
    * +knockback
- Hoe : "Fast Attack"
    * low-mid damage
    * high attack speed
- Pickage : "High Risk, High Damage"
    * very high damage
    * very low attack speed
    * -20% range

### Ranged
- Bow : 
    * Reduce arrow speed, make spread larger (enchantments can fix this)
- Crossbow :
    * Remove crit from arrows

### Special
- Trident : 
    * mid-high damage
    * +30% range
